# Setting up Misskey

This is an [Ansible](https://www.ansible.com/) role which installs [Misskey](https://misskey.com/) to run as a [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) container wrapped in a systemd service.

Misskey is a free and open-source collaborative wiki and documentation software, designed for seamless real-time collaboration. It can be used to manage a wiki, a knowledge base, project documentation, etc. It has various functions such as granular permissions management system, page history to track changes of articles, etc. It also supports diagramming tools like Draw.io, Excalidraw and Mermaid.

See the project's [documentation](https://misskey.com/docs/) to learn what Misskey does and why it might be useful to you.

## Prerequisites

To run a Misskey instance it is necessary to prepare a [Postgres](https://www.postgresql.org/) database server and [Redis](https://redis.io/) server for managing a metadata database.

If you are looking for Ansible roles for them, you can check out [ansible-role-postgres](https://github.com/mother-of-all-self-hosting/ansible-role-postgres) and [ansible-role-redis](https://github.com/mother-of-all-self-hosting/ansible-role-redis), both of which are maintained by the [Mother-of-All-Self-Hosting (MASH)](https://github.com/mother-of-all-self-hosting) team. The roles for [KeyDB](https://keydb.dev/) ([ansible-role-keydb](https://github.com/mother-of-all-self-hosting/ansible-role-keydb)) and [Valkey](https://valkey.io/) ([ansible-role-valkey](https://github.com/mother-of-all-self-hosting/ansible-role-valkey)) are available as well.

## Adjusting the playbook configuration

To enable Misskey with this role, add the following configuration to your `vars.yml` file.

**Note**: the path should be something like `inventory/host_vars/mash.example.com/vars.yml` if you use the [MASH Ansible playbook](https://github.com/mother-of-all-self-hosting/mash-playbook).

```yaml
########################################################################
#                                                                      #
# misskey                                                              #
#                                                                      #
########################################################################

misskey_enabled: true

########################################################################
#                                                                      #
# /misskey                                                             #
#                                                                      #
########################################################################
```

### Set the hostname

To enable the Misskey instance you need to set the hostname as well. To do so, add the following configuration to your `vars.yml` file. Make sure to replace `example.com` with your own value.

```yaml
misskey_hostname: "example.com"
```

After adjusting the hostname, make sure to adjust your DNS records to point the domain to your server.

**Note**: hosting Misskey under a subpath (by configuring the `misskey_path_prefix` variable) does not seem to be possible due to Misskey's technical limitations.

### Set variables for connecting to a Redis server

As described above, it is necessary to set up a [Redis](https://redis.io/) server for managing a metadata database of a Misskey instance. You can use either KeyDB or Valkey alternatively.

Having configured it, you need to add and adjust the following configuration to your `vars.yml` file, so that the Misskey instance will connect to the server:

```yaml
misskey_redis_username: ''
misskey_redis_password: ''
misskey_redis_hostname: YOUR_REDIS_SERVER_HOSTNAME_HERE
misskey_redis_port: 6379
misskey_redis_dbnumber: ''
```

Make sure to replace `YOUR_REDIS_SERVER_HOSTNAME_HERE` with the hostname of your Redis server. If the Redis server runs on the same host as Misskey, set `localhost`.

### Configure a storage backend

The service provides these storage backend options: local filesystem (default) and Amazon S3 compatible object storage.

#### Amazon S3 compatible object storage

To use Amazon S3 or a S3 compatible object storage, add the following configuration to your `vars.yml` file (adapt to your needs):

```yaml
misskey_environment_variable_storage_driver: s3

# Set a S3 access key ID
misskey_environment_variable_aws_s3_access_key_id: ''

# Set a S3 secret access key ID
misskey_environment_variable_aws_s3_secret_access_key: ''

# Set the the region where your S3 bucket is located
misskey_environment_variable_aws_s3_region: ''

# Set a S3 bucket name to use
misskey_environment_variable_aws_s3_bucket: ''

# The endpoint URL for your S3 service (optional; set if using a S3 compatible storage like Wasabi and Storj)
misskey_environment_variable_aws_s3_endpoint: ''

# Control whether to force path style URLs (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSJavaScriptSDK/latest/AWS/Config.html#s3ForcePathStyle-property) for S3 objects
misskey_environment_variable_aws_s3_force_path_style: false
```

### Configure the mailer

You can configure a mailer for functions such as user invitation. Misskey supports a SMTP server (default) and Postmark. To set it up, add the following common configuration and settings specific to SMTP server or Postmark to your `vars.yml` file as below (adapt to your needs):

```yaml
misskey_mailer_enabled: true

# Set the email address that emails will be sent from
misskey_environment_variable_mail_from_address: hello@example.com

# Set the name that emails will be sent from
misskey_environment_variable_mail_from_name: misskey
```

#### Use SMTP server (default)

To use a SMTP server, add the following configuration to your `vars.yml` file:

```yaml
# Set the hostname of the SMTP server
misskey_environment_variable_smtp_host: 127.0.0.1

# Set the port to use for the SMTP server
misskey_environment_variable_smtp_port: 587

# Set the username for the SMTP server
misskey_environment_variable_smtp_username: ''

# Set the password for the SMTP server
misskey_environment_variable_smtp_password: ''

# Control whether TLS is used when connecting to the server
misskey_environment_variable_smtp_secure: false

# Control whether SSL errors are ignored
misskey_environment_variable_smtp_ignoretls: false
```

⚠️ **Note**: without setting an authentication method such as DKIM, SPF, and DMARC for your hostname, emails are most likely to be quarantined as spam at recipient's mail servers. If you have set up a mail server with the [MASH project's exim-relay Ansible role](https://github.com/mother-of-all-self-hosting/ansible-role-exim-relay), you can enable DKIM signing with it. Refer [its documentation](https://github.com/mother-of-all-self-hosting/ansible-role-exim-relay/blob/main/docs/configuring-exim-relay.md#enable-dkim-support-optional) for details.

#### Use Postmark

To use Postmark, add the following configuration to your `vars.yml` file:

```yaml
misskey_environment_variable_mail_driver: postmark

# Set the token for Postmark
misskey_environment_variable_postmark_token: ''
```

### Extending the configuration

There are some additional things you may wish to configure about the component.

Take a look at:

- [`defaults/main.yml`](../defaults/main.yml) for some variables that you can customize via your `vars.yml` file. You can override settings (even those that don't have dedicated playbook variables) using the `misskey_environment_variables_additional_variables` variable

See its [environment variables](https://misskey.com/docs/self-hosting/environment-variables) for a complete list of Misskey's config options that you could put in `misskey_environment_variables_additional_variables`.

## Installing

After configuring the playbook, run the installation command of your playbook as below:

```sh
ansible-playbook -i inventory/hosts setup.yml --tags=setup-all,start
```

If you use the MASH playbook, the shortcut commands with the [`just` program](https://github.com/mother-of-all-self-hosting/mash-playbook/blob/main/docs/just.md) are also available: `just install-all` or `just setup-all`

## Usage

After running the command for installation, Misskey becomes available at the specified hostname like `https://example.com`.

To get started, open the URL on a web browser and create a first workspace by inputting required information. For an email address, make sure to input your own email address, not the one specified to `misskey_environment_variable_mail_from_address`.

## Troubleshooting

### Check the service's logs

You can find the logs in [systemd-journald](https://www.freedesktop.org/software/systemd/man/systemd-journald.service.html) by logging in to the server with SSH and running `journalctl -fu misskey` (or how you/your playbook named the service, e.g. `mash-misskey`).
